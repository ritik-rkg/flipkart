# Flipkart Grid 4.0 Hackathon Project

This repository contains the project submission for the *Flipkart Grid 4.0 Hackathon*. The project aims to solve real-world challenges in the retail and FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) industry using cutting-edge technology such as OCR (Optical Character Recognition), image recognition, and machine learning models for product identification, expiry validation, and freshness detection.

## Problem Statement

The goal is to develop solutions for the following four use cases:

### 1. *OCR to Extract Details from Image/Label*
- *Weightage*: 20%
- *Objective*: Extract key product details such as brand name, pack size, and other relevant information from product labels.
- *Example*: Use OCR to read brand details, pack size, and other information from packaging material.
- *Comments*: Models need to be trained to recognize a wide range of products, including FMCG, OTC health supplements, personal care products, and household items like cooking oil, toiletries, and packaged food.

### 2. *OCR for Expiry Date Validation*
- *Weightage*: 10%
- *Objective*: Extract and validate expiry dates printed on packaging.
- *Example*: Use OCR to extract expiry dates and MRP details from product labels.
- *Comments*: The solution should handle different date formats and accurately read expiry dates printed on packaging across various product types.

### 3. *Image Recognition and Infrared (IR) Based Counting*
- *Weightage*: 30%
- *Objective*: Implement image recognition techniques to identify and count products based on brand recognition.
- *Example*: Leverage machine learning to identify the product brand and count the number of products based on image data.
- *Comments*: The system should be capable of recognizing personal care products (e.g., deodorants, lipsticks) and household items, ensuring accurate recognition even in varied lighting conditions using IR.

### 4. *Detecting Freshness of Fresh Produce*
- *Weightage*: 40%
- *Objective*: Predict the shelf life and freshness of fruits and vegetables.
- *Example*: Analyze the freshness of produce by evaluating visual patterns and cues, and assess their shelf life.
- *Comments*: The solution should be able to handle various perishable items like fruits, vegetables, and bakery items, and determine their freshness using visual patterns.

## Technical Stack

- *OCR*: [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) or other OCR engines for text extraction from images.
- *Machine Learning*: Image recognition models (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) for detecting product brands and shelf-life prediction.
- *Infrared Technology*: IR-based recognition for count validation.
- *Data Processing*: Python for data processing and integration with OCR/ML models.
